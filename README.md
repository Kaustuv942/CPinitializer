# CPinitializer
This is a shell script code to intialize the templates for any cp contest with a single terminal line. Happy coding!

To make life easier, put template.cpp just outside the repo and put the complete address in its place. Eg. /home/ubuntu/CP/temp.cpp.

# How to run
```bash
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```
